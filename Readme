## Requirements

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi (or another device capable of running Node-RED)
- Temperature sensor (e.g., DHT11 or DS18B20)
- Actuators (e.g., fan, LEDs) to respond to sensor data
- Optional: Other IoT sensors like humidity, pressure, etc.

### Software
- Node.js (for running Node-RED)
- Node-RED installed (see installation instructions below)
- Python or any AI service API (for AI integration)
- MQTT Broker (for communication between devices, optional)
